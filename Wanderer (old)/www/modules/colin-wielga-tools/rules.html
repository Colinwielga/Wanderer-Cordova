    Tools are what your character has to work with when solving problems. They can be anything from being good at climbing to have a fancy gown. The DM will take these in to account when selecting the difficulty of a challenge (there is no defined algorithm here just they should have impact) .Start the game with 6 tools, add more at the DM discursion.

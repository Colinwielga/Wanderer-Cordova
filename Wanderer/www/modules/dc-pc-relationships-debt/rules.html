    <p>Each player has zero-sum debt with all the other player characters. Whenever you change it,
    the other player should change theirs by the same amount in the opposite direction.</p>

    <p>See the Pay Back Debt move to find out how you can push the balance back in your favor.
    See the Cash In Your Dues move to find out how to spend debt to get the other character
    to do what you want. (Note that you can always offer someone 1 debt in exchange for a little
    something, no matter what the balance between you is. Their call if they go for it.)</p>

    The gods’ opinion of your character. At the start of the game select 3 gods that favor your character and 3 scorn your character. As the game progresses the DM dictates how the gods views of you changes. Mechanically, every god has a card that represents them in your deck, this card will be different depending on your relationship with the god.

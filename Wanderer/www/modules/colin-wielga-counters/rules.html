    Hit Points:
</h3>

<p class="rules-text">
    Start the game with 8 HP and 4 encounter HP. Damage is taken in units of hits. A hit corresponds to a random amount of damage, averaging 1 HP. Damage is subtracted from encounter HP and then from normal HP when encounter HP is 0. At the end of a scene (DM's discretion) click "end scene" to recover encounter HP.

    Facts:
</h3>
<p class="rules-text">
    Start each session with 3 facts. A fact can be used to make something true by saying "Fact: &lt;thing you want to be true&gt;". A fact can always be vetoed by the DM or by another player if they spend one fact of their own. Regardless of whether or not your fact is vetoed, you must always spend a fact point. Facts are useful for getting out of sticky situations, adding color to the world, and trolling other players.

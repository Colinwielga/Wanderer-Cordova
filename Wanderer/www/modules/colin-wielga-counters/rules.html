    Start each session with 3 facts. A fact can be used to make something true by saying “FACT: <thing you want to be true>”. A fact can be vetoed by the DM or by another player if they spend one of their facts. Even if you fact is vetoed you will have to spend a fact point. Facts are useful for getting out of sticky situations, adding color to the world and trolling other players.

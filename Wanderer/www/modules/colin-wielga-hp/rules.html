<p class="rules-text">
    Start the game with 8 HP and 4 encounter HP. Damage is taken in units of hits. A hit corresponds to a random amount of damage, averaging 1 HP. Damage is subtracted from encounter HP and then from normal HP when encounter HP is 0. At the end of a scene (DM's discretion) click "end scene" to recover encounter HP.

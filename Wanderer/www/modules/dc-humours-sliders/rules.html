    <p>When you draw+discard, look at the appropriate humour's current level. For each color panel in the discarded card that matches the color of this humour, cast your gaze one spot farther to the right of the marked level. This level to the right of your marked level will determine the outcome of the move. (Do NOT change the actual level of the humour. The way to increase your humour's actual level is described below.)</p> 

    <p>For example: If your Phlegm is at Balanced and you discard a card with one green panel, your result will be Waxing. If you discard a card with two green panels, your result will be Sated. If your Phlegm is at Waxing and you discard a card with one green panel, your result will be Sated. Any result beyond Sated is still Sated. If you discard a card with no panels of the related color, your result is whatever your humour's current level is: This means that if your Phlegm is at Waxing and you discard any card at all, you are guaranteed at least a Waxing result. On the other hand, if you choose to draw but not discard, you will cede initiative to the MC, regardless of your humour's level.</p> 

    <p>At any time other than between a draw and a discard, you can discard three cards from your hand that all share a common color - each can have either one or two panels of it. When you do, increase the current level of the humour by one step: Waning becomes Balanced, Balanced becomes Waxing, Waxing becomes Sated. If a humour is at Sated, immediately reset it to Balanced and pick a player advancement for that humour. (Likewise, if a humour ever reaches Dry, reset it immediately to Balanced and tell the MC that they can pick an MC advancement for you from that humour's list.) You can only pick each advancement once. You can wait to pick it until the end of the current scene if you don't want to interrupt the action.</p>

    <p>If your humour is at Waning, you don't need to spend three cards to improve it - see the moves for resetting humours.</p>

    <p>The levels of the humours do not necessarily represent your character's temperment - only their current ability to benefit from that aspect of their temperment. Roleplay them however you choose, regardless of humour levels. Note however that the MC might use your waxing humours to justify missteps on your part, should you cede initiative while any humour is so high. Also note that demons can smell your humours and will become very interested in you should you leave them too high for too long.</p>

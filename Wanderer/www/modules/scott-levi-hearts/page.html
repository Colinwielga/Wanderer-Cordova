        you can play more than one game at once

        this game object knows all the stuff about the game

            haha, that will run

    here! - this is the cards you have in your hand
    we are going to use something called ng-class
    it let's you give a div a class when a condition is true

    so we can give this a not-your-trun class

    when it is not your turn

    and we can tie our rule to it

    and will be awesome

    but I don't really remebmer how ng-class works

    so we need to find an example

    can you paste an example here?

    I remember the syntax is strange


        we need ng-class not ng-if
                                                                another method
                                                another class
        ng-class="{'can-close':page.canClose(), 'cannot-close':!page.canClose()}"
                    ^class     |
                               ^a method, when the method is true the element will get the class
        ok- so - weird syntax


        we need to fill in those ??

        I wish

        just do the work for me
            haha
            naw, we got to do it the hard way

        ng-class is confusing so I would not worry about it, if it does not make sense

            we just need to go in our JS and find somehting that tells us if it is our turn

            probably something on a game object

            do you know the '!'?
            it generally means not

            so !game.IsYourTurn

            means not game.IsYourTurn

            yeah,

            so this:

            'not-your-turn':!game.IsYourTurn

            reads:

            when '!game.IsYourTurn' apply the class 'not-your-turn'

            cool?

            now we should add that class to our css


    -->
        <div class="card-cards-container" ng-class="{'not-your-turn':!game.IsYourTurn, 'your-turn':game.IsYourTurn}">
            <div ng-repeat="card in game.hand"
                 class="scott-levi-card-container wrapped-card"
                 ng-click="game.play(card)"

                {{game.oppo}}

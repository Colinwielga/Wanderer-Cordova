    <p>When you advance a humour to Sated, reset it to Balanced and pick a Player Advancement for that humour.</p>
    
    <p>When you deplete a humour to Dry, reset it to Balanced and tell the MC to pick an MC Advancement for that humour.</p>
    
    <p>Advancements can only be picked once each, unless they explicitly say otherwise.</p>
    
    <p>When you have at least one player advancement and at least one MC advancement for each humour, 
    the "Ungiven Future" advancements will unlock. When those are available, whenever you have the opportunity 
    to choose a player advancement for any humour, you may instead choose an Ungiven Future advancement.</p>

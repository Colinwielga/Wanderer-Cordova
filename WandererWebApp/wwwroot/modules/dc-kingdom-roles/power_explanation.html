<p>When you have Power, you have authority over the Kingdom. You decide what the Kingdom does and what it doesn't do. You tell people what to do and they do it.</p>

<p><b>When you're in a Scene or Reaction...</b></p>
<p>You can use your <b>authority</b> to make the Kingdom do something to another character: throw them in jail, give them a raise, etc. Describe how you make it happen.</p>
<p>You cannot use Power to control another player's character, but you can threaten or bribe characters to make them do what you want. Power does not let you change another character's Role. You can throw a Perspective character in prison, but that does not stop them from being right.</p>
<p>You can also give orders that are only carried out if the Crossroad result you specify is chosen. Use the Kingdom Countdowns module to add your orders to the Crossroad.</p>

<p><b>When a Crossroad is resolved...</b></p>
<p>You decide whether the Kingdom says Yes or No to the Crossroad. Your decision is final unless other Powers disagree or Power is taken away from you.</p>

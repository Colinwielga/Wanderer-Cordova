<p>When you're a Touchstone, you reflect the desires of the people of the Kingdom. How you feel is how the people feel. What you care about is what the people care about.</p>

<p><b>When you're in a Scene or Reaction...</b></p>
<p>You decide how the people of the Kingdom feel by showing how your character feels. As soon as we see your character react or express an opinion, we know that is the <b>attitude</b> of the people too. You can instantly change the entire Kingdom.</p>

<p><b>On your turn...</b></p>
<p>After playing your scene, you have the option to check Crisis if you think the Kingdom is going down the drain or erase a Crisis check if you think things are calming down. This is in addition to the box you normally check at the end of your Scene (you could even check Crisis twice). Describe the change you see in the Kingdom.</p>

<p><b>When a Crossroad is resolved...</b></p>
<p>You show how the people of the Kingdom react to what happened by checking or unchecking Crisis.</p>

<p>When you have Perspective, you understand the Kingdom, both its merits and flaws. You can forsee the consequences of decisions the Kingdom makes. You can see the truth, whether or not anyone else believes you.</p>

<p><b>When you're in a Scene or Reaction...</b></p>
<p>You can <b>predict</b> the consequences of the Crossroad. Pick either Yes or No, then declare something that will happen if that outcome is chosen. The prediction can be good or bad for the Kingdom as you wish. Make predictions about the Kingdom, not specific characters.</p>
<p>Use the Kingdom Countdowns module to add predictions to the Crossroad.</p>

<p><b>When a Crossroad is resolved...</b></p>
<p>You decide if your prediction comes true. Predictions are accurate by default, but things may have changed enough that you no longer think it should happen.</p>

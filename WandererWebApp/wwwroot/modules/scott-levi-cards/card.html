<!-- here we have scott-levi-card

    here is a selector from the css file:

    #scott-levi-cards div.card-in-deck{

    }

    there are two parts to the selector:

    #scott-levi-cards -- this says look at all the elements inside #scott-levi-cards elements

    and

    div.card-in-deck -- this says: next look for a div with the class 'card-in-deck'

    and... I am confused because card-in-deck is nowhere to be seen :/

    did I lose you?  I picked a bad example

    cool

    so..

    we need to select:

    scott-levi-card s
    inside the hearts module
    in games where it is not your turn
    and make them grey

    -->

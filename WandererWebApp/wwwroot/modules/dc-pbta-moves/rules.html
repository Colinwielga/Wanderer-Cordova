<span class="rules-text">
    <p>Apocalypse Engine-style moves. A move is simply a fictional and/or mechanical trigger attached to a 
    fictional and/or mechanical outcome. If you do something in the game that counts as an instance of the
    trigger, the move happens: "If you do it, you do it." If you want to make the move happen, you have to do something in the game
    that counts as an instance of the trigger: "To do it, do it."</p>

    <p>If you're trying to come up with a move but you're stumped for ideas, here are some things that can trigger
    moves:
    <ul>
        <li>When your character does something.</li>
        <li>When your character does something under particular circumstances.</li>
        <li>When someone else does something to your character.</li>
        <li>When your character finds themself in a particular situation.</li>
        <li>When your character's stats are in a particular state.</li>
        <li>When another move is invoked.</li>
        <li>Instead of another move that would have been invoked.</li>
        <li>At the beginning or end of the session.</li>
        <li>Between sessions or when there's downtime in play.</li>
        <li>When you spend a point from a reserve.</li>
        <li>When something important to your character is at stake.</li>
        <li>When your character uses a thing.</li>
        <li>From now on.</li>
        <li>Immediately upon creation and never again.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>And here are some effects that moves can cause:
    <ul>
        <li>Roll dice or draw/discard from the deck.</li>
        <li>Substitute or change stats.</li>
        <li>Offer choices from a list.</li>
        <li>Ask someone to provide particular details.</li>
        <li>Ask someone to answer a question.</li>
        <li>Change your character's circumstances directly.</li>
        <li>Alter the way a different move works.</li>
        <li>Mark progress towards advancement.</li>
        <li>Start or advance a countdown.</li>
        <li>Call for a price to be paid.</li>
        <li>Hold points to be spent over time.</li>
        <li>Specify who gets to make a particular decision.</li>
    </ul>
    Complex moves might combine multiple options from both lists. Don't hold back. Do what feels right.

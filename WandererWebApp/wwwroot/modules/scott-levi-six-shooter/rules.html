       Welcome to {Qwi}, a hospitable planet predominantly populated by: tribal crabfolk, oxygen producing flora, megafauna, and colonizers. 
       There has been a recent influx of private contractors who have been hired either as resource extractors or to put down any crabfolk resistance.
       Many are simultaneously involved with various android uprisings for or against the Intergalactic Corporate Syndicate, who controls pockets of civilized sectors on the planet.
       The capitol city has high tech things like: a nuclear powered space elevator and matter refabricators. 
       However, outside of the wealthy elite, most beings live like it's the American Old West with limited food/medical supplies, roving outlaw bands, and plenty of exploitation. 
       
       
       This is a hexcrawl where players create their own PBtA inspired moves and resource counters. Your dropship crashed during a storm, and now in order to survive,
       you must reunite the party and choose a side.

    <h1>Fool&rsquo;s Journey Through Tarot Land</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Sci Fantasy RPG set in humanity&rsquo;s future, on a distant planet.</li>
        <li>Designed to be played on the Wanderer App (wanderer-rpg.com/blog &amp; Wanderer RPG on the Windows App Store).</li>
        <li>Players interact with cards in the Tarot Module, 2x12 in Wanderer. They will also need the Counters, HP, and Notes Modules.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Skill checks involve discarding cards against the DM, a.k.a. the Dealer or fate depending on how you look at things.</li>
        <li>Player Characters will pass, fail, or get a mixed result</li>
        <li>Players should have no more than <u>seven</u> cards in their Hand at a time.</li>
        <li>Before making skill checks, Players have an opportunity to discard any amount of cards and draw that many cards. The more difficult the objective, the higher the required Poker Hand.&nbsp; For example, Players may discard three card straights to make a special move or attack.</li>
        <li>In game, Player Characters collect Cards randomly generated by their scroll computers processors. The Cards are a part of an ancient reward system that allows individual Characters to operate and level up their power armor.&nbsp; People may exist outside of Avatars, but then they lack all weaponry, magick capabilities, building, or anything considered modern.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Power Armor:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each character and NPC has fully customizable, Mecha Avatar Power Armor. It protects them beneath A.I.-assisted, super-hardened boron/silver/crystal alloy mech suits.&nbsp; Referred to in game as Avatars.&nbsp; Players may decide how their armor&rsquo;s controls function and other unique features like telepathic controls, personalized mobility enhancements, or solar derived energy.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>All Power Armor comes equipped with invisible, Halo Spartan style, force field shielding and Halo 5 but omnidirectional afterburner. Shielding protects the Players, Core Hit Points (HP Wanderer Module), and self-replenishes between fights. <strong>Shield health is shown as Encounter HP</strong>, soaking up damage before your Core Hit Points take damage. Killing blows will typically involve a &ldquo;double tap&rdquo; to bring down someone&rsquo;s shields before landing the final fatal strike.&nbsp; Few attacks have the raw power to &ldquo;one-shot&rdquo; someone with their Shielding at full charge.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The power armor is controlled and powered by the Character&rsquo;s Scroll. A cylindrical computer that can unroll to generate a virtual screen, and does everything computational for the Armor user.&nbsp; The Scroll may also be used as a deadly energy weapon (light saber).&nbsp; This small rod is the only weak spot, both the brain and heart, of the Power Armor. &nbsp;If destroyed, the armor powers down and is immobile.</li>
        <li>To communicate, other then through the tesseract web; each set includes thin ventricles willed with super rigid air that can spiritually be aligned to speak and listen inside.</li>
        <li>All characters with armor can cast Magick if they have a magickal item like a wand or pentacle, a palm-sized memento. Similar to a scroll in that both can be destroyed.&nbsp; What is magick? Another way to think about it as coordinated phenomena.</li>
        <li>Armor also has thrusters built in allowing floating or boosting in any direction.</li>
        <li>Your first set of armor is free in order to work the fields of Weedsville. Succeeding ones, not so much.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Major Arcana cards (The Fool[0] through the World[21]):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Major Arcana Cards can be moved from Players&rsquo; Hands to &ldquo;In Play:&rdquo; increasing the Character&rsquo;s Level in an Archetype Class depending on the card.</li>
        <li>The numerical value will determine which Archetype Class Players can take a Level in. Each class has its own conditional Special power that triggers based on the position of the cards &ldquo;In Play.&rdquo;</li>
        <li>Leveling up can only occur when the Players have access to a Robotic Fortuneteller and can pass the Coin check fee. After inserting a scroll into the Fortuneteller&rsquo;s base, the scroll will be imbued by Major Arcana Cards.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Minor Arcana cards (Ace[low] through King):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tarot decks have four suits ours are the: <em>Pentacles,</em> <em>Wands,</em> <em>Swords,</em> and <em>Cups</em>.</li>
        <li>Aces count as low, and Tarot decks have 4 face cards; Pages, Knights, Queens, and Kings.</li>
        <li>These cards can only be used towards skill checks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Questions for PCs:
    </h2>
    <p>What is your character&rsquo;s Genre composition? What does their Mecha Avatar look like? In Tarot Land, looks are based on what Music subculture(s) your character associates with (think of this like Race in DnD)?</p>
    <p>There are many subgenres, but the main groups are: Blues/R&amp;B, Electronic, Folk/World, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Metal, Natural, Punk, and Rock.</p>
    <p>How does your character move around? Is it magical, mechanical, hovering, landsharking, zip-lining, etc.?</p>
    <p>Which element does you character favor for bending powers? Pick only one element, no going back! A commonality among NPCs will be cross classing just the first Wand level to bend an element.&nbsp; Which will you wield: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water?</p>
    <p>What does your character grow on Weedsville? Is it necessary for an aspect or well being of your character, or is it just for Coin. &nbsp;Do you reserve some of your product for yourself and are you addicted to it?</p>
    <p>What is your characters &lsquo;Realistic&rsquo; Monochromatic Holographic Animal Familiar (&trade;), a.k.a. your pocket companion? Pick any animal, and name it; it is projected from your Scroll. It is a single color and your your faithful pet, that helps your character farm.&nbsp; It can make special attacks or use abilities from the Special Moves list.</p>
